# DC-DC-Boost-Converter-Design-SIMULINK
This repository consists MATLAB/SIMULINK file for DC/DC boost converter designed to meet the following requirements. (1)Input voltage varies (20𝑉 ≤ 𝑉𝑖𝑛 ≤ 28𝑉, 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑛𝑜𝑚) = 24𝑉. (2) Load Current varies (8𝐴 ≤ 𝑖𝑂 ≤ 16𝐴). (3) Switching frequency is  𝑓𝑆 = 100𝑘𝐻𝑧. (4) Vout needs to be 𝑉𝑂 = 48𝑉. (5) ripple voltage 𝑉𝑟/𝑉𝑂 = 4%.
